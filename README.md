A simple marks registering and report making project that accepts the marks, converts to grades and analyses the marks of the particular student through various libraries like pyttsx3, pandas, matplotlib, sqlite3.
It is also linked to a MySQL database where data is appended and is also used to extract and use the data accordingly as we use the app.
This is a partially developed project, I am looking forward to make it to a Web App and also add multiple functions to it of PDF generation, etc.
